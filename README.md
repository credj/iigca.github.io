## 👋 Hi there!

### About Me

## About Me

Hi! I’m Cyrus Redjaee-- a senior at the University of Michigan pursuing a dual degree in **Economics** and **Jazz & Contemplative Studies**. My academic path blends analytical thinking with creative expression, and that same interdisciplinary mindset drives my professional interests in **data analytics, sustainability, and business strategy**.

Through roles in marketing, project management, and financial operations, I’ve developed a strong foundation in tools like **Python**, **R**, and **Excel** while tackling real-world challenges. As a **Sustainability Analyst** at the University of Michigan, I built predictive models to forecast energy demand and identify opportunities to cut carbon emissions by 18% across Detroit’s urban grid. More recently, I ran my own painting business through **College Works Painting**, gaining hands-on leadership experience in sales, team management, and client relations.

In addition to my academic and work experiences, I’ve earned multiple **Global Career Accelerator (GCA)** certifications to sharpen my skills in applied data analytics and digital strategy:
- ✅ *Data Analytics – Part 1 & 2*
- ✅ *Coding for Data – Part 1*
- ✅ *Digital Marketing – Part 1*

I'm passionate about using data to drive smarter decisions — whether it’s optimizing sustainable energy systems, improving business operations, or developing insights that make an impact. I’m currently seeking opportunities in **data analytics**, **sustainability consulting**, or **business intelligence** starting in 2026.
